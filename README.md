### 🗺️ **Project Overview**  
2D on-chain gaming app/platform, featuring a rogue-like experience with procedural generation, dynamic gameplay, and strategic depth.



### 🎯 **Key Goals & Objectives**  
WindStark aims to offer a challenging and engaging rogue-like game with procedurally generated levels and a unique rewind mechanic that blends strategy, skill, and creativity. The game provides an exciting and innovative experience for both casual and hardcore gamers.

### 🌍 **Project goals and why does it matter?**  
WindStark brings a fresh take to the rogue-like genre with its rewind ability, offering players a dynamic way to overcome challenges. By combining fast-paced decision-making and creative problem-solving, it appeals to a wide variety of players. The planned expansion into NFTs and a marketplace will further enhance the game's replayability and engagement, while introducing a competitive, reward-based ecosystem.

### 🧩 **Target Audience**  
- Gamers who enjoy fast-paced, skill-based challenges with high replayability.
- Fans of rogue-like games, minimalist art styles, and strategic gameplay.
- Players looking for innovation in gameplay mechanics and an evolving game economy.


### 🎉 **Core Features & Benefits**  

📌 **Feature 1: Rewind Ability**  
The rewind ability allows players to retrace their steps, strategize rapid movements, and make tactical escapes, adding depth and excitement to gameplay.

📌 **Feature 3: NFT Avatars & Marketplace (Future Expansion)**  
Players will soon be able to collect and use unique avatars as NFTs within the game. These avatars will serve as in-game assets with customizable traits and abilities, and a marketplace will allow players to trade, sell, and purchase avatars.

📌 **Feature 4: Leaderboard & Staking-Based Matches(Future Expansion)**  
A competitive leaderboard will track the best players based on their high scores. Players can engage in staking-based matches, where staking tokens or avatars will influence the matchmaking system and potentially yield rewards based on performance.

A competitive leaderboard will track the best players based on their high scores. Players can engage in staking-based matches, where staking tokens or avatars will influence the matchmaking system and potentially yield rewards based on performance.

### 💡 **How It Works (Simplified)**  

**Step One:** Navigate through procedurally generated levels while avoiding red orbs and black walls. Keep an eye on your health, which depletes over time.  

**Step Two:** Use the rewind ability to retrace your steps, dodge dangerous areas, and eliminate red orbs to replenish health. Strategy and timing are key to surviving the increasingly difficult challenges.  

**Final Outcome:** Reach the white door at the end of each level to progress and unlock upgrades. As you advance, the levels become more complex, with additional obstacles and tougher enemies.
