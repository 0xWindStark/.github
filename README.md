# <img src="https://github.com/shibiki-labs/.github/blob/main/icon.png" alt="WindStark Icon" width="30" height="30"> **WindStark**
- Fans of rogue-like games, minimalist art styles, and strategic gameplay.
- Players looking for innovation in gameplay mechanics and an evolving game economy.


### 🎉 **Core Features & Benefits**  

📌 **Feature 1: Rewind Ability**  
The rewind ability allows players to retrace their steps, strategize rapid movements, and make tactical escapes, adding depth and excitement to gameplay.

📌 **Feature 3: NFT Avatars & Marketplace (Future Expansion)**  
Players will soon be able to collect and use unique avatars as NFTs within the game. These avatars will serve as in-game assets with customizable traits and abilities, and a marketplace will allow players to trade, sell, and purchase avatars.

📌 **Feature 4: Leaderboard & Staking-Based Matches(Future Expansion)**  
A competitive leaderboard will track the best players based on their high scores. Players can engage in staking-based matches, where staking tokens or avatars will influence the matchmaking system and potentially yield rewards based on performance.

📌 **Feature 4: Leaderboard & Staking-Based Matches(Future Expansion)**  
A competitive leaderboard will track the best players based on their high scores. Players can engage in staking-based matches, where staking tokens or avatars will influence the matchmaking system and potentially yield rewards based on performance.

### 💡 **How It Works (Simplified)**  

**Step One:** Navigate through procedurally generated levels while avoiding red orbs and black walls. Keep an eye on your health, which depletes over time.  

**Step Two:** Use the rewind ability to retrace your steps, dodge dangerous areas, and eliminate red orbs to replenish health. Strategy and timing are key to surviving the increasingly difficult challenges.  

**Final Outcome:** Reach the white door at the end of each level to progress and unlock upgrades. As you advance, the levels become more complex, with additional obstacles and tougher enemies. 




### 🌍 **Impact & Vision**

🚀 **Why This Project Matters:**  
WindStark redefines player engagement with its minimalist design and innovative mechanics. Procedural generation offers limitless replayability, while the rewind mechanic adds a new layer of strategy. As the game expands with NFT avatars, a marketplace, and staking-based competitive gameplay, it creates a unique, rewarding experience for players.
📈 **Future Plans:**  
- Complete Unity integration for the game and on-chain features.
- Include ERC20 tokens as in game rewards and currencies.
- Expand the game to include ERC721 NFT avatars, with customizable traits and abilities.
- Develop a marketplace where players can trade, buy, and sell NFTs.
- Implement a competitive leaderboard and introduce staking-based matches.
- Add new upgrade paths and abilities to enhance strategic depth.
- Design themed levels with additional environmental challenges.
- Launch a platform where players can discover and play other fast-paced rogue-like games.

🏆 **Unique Value:**  
The rewind mechanic gives WindStark a strategic edge over other rogue-like games. The minimalist design emphasizes focus, and the integration of NFT avatars and a marketplace creates an evolving ecosystem where players can interact, compete, and collect unique in-game assets.

🌟 **Community Impact:**  
WindStark promotes skill-building, adaptability, and critical thinking. The game’s evolving ecosystem encourages players to engage with the game over the long term, fostering a community centered on creativity, competition, and rewards.
